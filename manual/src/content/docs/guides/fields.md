Fields are shown under their record in the [Schema Tree](/dspf-edit/guides/schema-tree/), listing name, length, type, position (row/column), and flags such as *referenced* or *hidden*.

## Add a field

Right-click a record and choose **New Field**, or click **+ Field** in the [Screen Preview](/dspf-edit/guides/screen-preview/) toolbar and click a point on the screen to place it there. Both use the same prompts to collect name, type, length, and position.

## Edit / Rename / Remove

- **Edit Field** — change a field's attributes.
- **Rename** — change a field's name, updating references to it.
- **Remove field** — delete it from the record.
- **Copy Field** — duplicate it, to the same record or a different one.

## Position

- **Change Position** — move it to an absolute row/column, or position it relative to an existing field or constant.
- **Center** — center it horizontally on the screen.
- You can also drag a field directly in the [Screen Preview](/dspf-edit/guides/screen-preview/), or nudge it with the tree's **Move Field Left/Right (1)** and **Move Field Left/Right (5)** commands.

## Colors and attributes

**Colors** and **Attributes** apply `DSPATR`-style color/attribute keywords to the field. See [Colors and Attributes](/dspf-edit/guides/colors-attributes/).

## Validity checks

**Add validity checks** applies DDS field-validation keywords (e.g. range/comparison/value checks) to the field.

## Editing keywords

**Add editing keywords** applies DDS edit keywords (e.g. `EDTCDE()`/`EDTWRD()`) that control how the field's value is formatted for display. The [Screen Preview](/dspf-edit/guides/screen-preview/) renders `EDTCDE()`-edited numeric fields using the decimal convention configured in [Configuration](/dspf-edit/guides/configuration/).

## Error messages

**Add error messages** attaches a DDS error-message keyword (e.g. `ERRMSG()`) to the field, shown in the preview per the same message-line rules as window `ERRMSG()` — see [Screen Preview](/dspf-edit/guides/screen-preview/#windows).

## Indicators

**Add / Remove / Change indicators** conditions the field's visibility, following the same AND/OR rules as constants and attributes — see [Indicators and Conditions](/dspf-edit/guides/indicators/).

## Referenced fields

A field referencing another file's field definition (an `R` field with no explicit type/length) shows a *referenced* flag in the tree. See [Referenced Fields](/dspf-edit/guides/referenced-fields/) to resolve its real type, length, and decimals from a connected IBM i.
