### Refactored

### Fixed

### Changed
- Improved subfile record creation (both regular and window subfiles):
  - Every subfile is created with a control record (header), and the subfile record (detail).
  - The control record is created with: SFLSIZ, SFLPAG, OVERLAY, RTNCSRLOC, SFLCSRRRN, SFLDSP, SFLDSPCTL,
    SFLCLR and SFLEND. SFLDSP, SFLDSPCTL, SLFEND with N80 indicator, and SFLCLR with 80 indicator.
    Also some hidden fields are added: NRR, NBR, WSRECNAM, WSFLDNAM, and WSFLRRN.
    (all this will be configurable in future versions).

## [0.7.0] - 2025-09-14

  If copying a field, you must provide a new name if one with the same name already exists in the destination record.
